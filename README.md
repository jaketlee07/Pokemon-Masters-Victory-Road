For the WildPokemon obejcts I made 2 static wild pokemon named Ditto and Piplup that stay put until a trainer has come to them. Once the trainer and the WildPokemon are in the same place, the WildPokemon will follow the trainer at reduce the trainers health by the attack value of the WildPokemon and the WildPokemon looses 1 health per tic.

For my new object command the user inputs the type of object they want ("c", "g", "t", or "w"). Then the user is prompted the rest of the parameters of the object one by one for them to see which values will go to the object. For the case that the object id is greater than one it will return an error and not allow the object to have the id.
